## v1.0.0 — Stable System Baseline

This release marks the first **stable, intentional version** of the project.

The core architecture, constraints, and mental model are now locked.

---

### ✅ What’s Included

- Defined system structure and canonical directories
- Enforced separation between:
  - truth (context)
  - format (skills)
  - examples (knowledge)
- Deterministic behavior rules to prevent drift and hallucinations
- Static Explorer UI for inspecting the full system state
- Clear setup path for Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and local tools

---

### 🧠 What This Means

- You can adopt this system without fear of breaking changes
- The philosophy and boundaries are explicit
- Future releases will be **additive**, not chaotic

This is the foundation everything else will build on.

---

### 🚫 What This Is Not (Yet)

- No plugin ecosystem
- No hosted backend
- No auto-sync or SaaS layer
- No attempt to serve every use case

Those are **intentional non-goals** for v1.

---

### 🔒 Stability Guarantees

The following are now considered stable:

- Repository structure
- Core context schemas
- Skill file philosophy
- Claims enforcement approach
- Tool-agnostic design

Breaking changes, if ever required, will trigger a major version bump.

---

### 🔭 What’s Next

Planned for v1.x:

- Additional skills
- Improved Explorer UX
- Documentation expansions
- Optional automation helpers

The core system will remain intact.

---

### 🧾 Notes

- MIT licensed
- Feedback via Issues or Discussions
- PRs welcome if aligned with the system philosophy
