## 6️⃣ Final Assembly Checklist

Before saving, confirm:

- [ ] Can this be understood without the README?
- [ ] Does it sound like a **tool**, not a pitch?
- [ ] Would an engineer trust it?
- [ ] Does it match what the repo actually does?
- [ ] Does it avoid inflated claims?

If all are true → ship it.

> GitHub is not a landing page.
> GitHub is a credibility surface.

Clarity > cleverness
Accuracy > hype
Systems > slogans
