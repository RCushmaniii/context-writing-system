# Business Profile Interview Guide

## Purpose of This Document

This interview guide defines the structured discovery questions used to produce
a `business-profile.json` file. The intent is to capture a **production-grade
representation of a business**, not a marketing persona or pitch deck summary.

The resulting business profile should:

- Reflect how the business actually operates
- Encode strategic tradeoffs and constraints
- Preserve the founder/operator’s real language
- Be usable by AI systems without hallucination risk

This guide is suitable for:

- Human-led discovery interviews
- AI-assisted or fully AI-led interviews
- Incremental prompt-based profile generation

---

## How to Use This Guide

- Ask questions in order when possible
- Prefer verbatim answers over paraphrasing
- Capture specificity (numbers, ranges, examples)
- Flag uncertainty instead of forcing polish
- Treat “not a fit” answers as first-class data
