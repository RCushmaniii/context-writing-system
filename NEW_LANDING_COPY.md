## Problem Section

### Section Header

**Why Qualified Candidates Get Rejected**

### Problem 1: ATS Black Hole

**75% of resumes never reach human eyes**

Applicant tracking systems auto-reject resumes before recruiters see them. Your qualifications don't matter if you can't get past the first filter.

### Problem 2: Missing Keywords

**Recruiters scan for specific terms**

Without the right keywords, your resume goes straight to the rejection pile. Most job seekers have no idea what terms they're missing.

### Problem 3: Time Waste

**Hours spent customizing for each application**

Tailoring your resume for every job posting takes time you could spend networking or interviewing.
